<p>We have taken every effort to design Madison to be useful, informative, helpful, honest and fun. Hopefully we've accomplished that - and would ask that you let us know if you'd like to see improvements or changes that would make it even easier for you to find and use the information you need and want.</p>
<p>All we ask is that you agree to abide by the following Terms and Conditions. Take a few minutes to look them over because by using our site you automatically agree to them. Naturally, if you don't agree, <script type="text/javascript">

<h2 id="non-profit-exemptions">Non-Profit Exemptions</h2>
<p>OpenGov is <em>not</em> for profit and is organized under section 501(c)3 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. That means we must comply with certain U.S. Government policies <a href="http://www.irs.gov/Charities-&amp;-Non-Profits/Charitable-Organizations/Exemption-Requirements-Section-501(c)(3)-Organizations">helpfully explained here by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)_organization#501.28c.29.283.29">here by Wikipedians</a>. One policy is a prohibition on advocating for or against candidates for public office. We will make a good faith effort to ensure content on OpenGov websites is compliant.</p>
<p>Please email questions, comments or concerns about OpenGov compliance to <a href="sayhello@opengovfoundation.org">sayhello@opengovfoundation.org</a>.</p>
